# TODO prepipy, in no particular order...

* **Big one**: Check if stiff stretching case selection is implemented correctly (probably not)...
* quantile, percentile, nan-
* Make autostretch useable again.
* Simplify choice of stretch mode, passing function should not be necessary.
* If bands.yml not found &rarr; try to use those specified in config, if not &rarr; glob
* Command-line mode with \* in image name for multiple &rarr; maybe this can replace the current `-m` keyword, which could then become mask.
* Put parameters for different stiff modes in separate config file? Should not have to be read every time stretch is run though...
* Check relative paths for config files using ./ when running from command-line, especially in Linux.
* Multiprocessing is not using filename template...
* Maybe add Gaussian stretching if not too complicated.
