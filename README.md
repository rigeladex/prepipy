# prepipy

PREtty PIctures using PYthon

## Overview

This package provides the ability to stretch and combine astronomical images from multiple bands into (RGB) colour images.

Images can be created in two main modes:
- JPEG image containing only the image in the pixel scale of the input, including coordinate information readable by e.g. [Aladin](https://aladin.u-strasbg.fr/).
- *DEVELOPMENT* Matplotlib image containing one ore more RGB conmibations from different bands in a grid layout. World coordinate axes are plotted on the images if available in the original input files. An additional sup-header containing the source name can be included. This mode also supportes multiple different options, such as plotting grid lines on top of the image, marking the center point in the image, of marking additional points of interest within the image, specified by world coordinates. By default, these images are saved in the pdf format.

## What does prepipy *not* do?

- Create an astrometric solution for input images. This must be provided in the FITS headers of the input images. Use a tool like e.g. [SCAMP](https://www.astromatic.net/software/scamp/) for this task.
- Resample the individual images to the same pixel scale. Input images must match exactly in terms of pixel scale, orientation and size (number of pixels along each axis). Prepipy assumes the input images can simply be added on a pixel-by-pixel basis. Use a tool like e.g. [SWarp](https://www.astromatic.net/software/swarp/) for this task.

## Example image

## Basic Usage

### JPEG mode

Current way to use from command line: run the `rgbcombo` script with arguments as described in the help message.

### Matplotlib mode

Development feature, not part of the current release.

### Input data

The input images are expected to fullfill the following criteria:
- FITS format images with the images data appearing in the primary HDU.
- Pixel scale and position matching across all input images. No additional resampling/reprojection is performed.
- WCS information is present in the FITS files.

### Setting options

The package currently uses two YAML configuration files to specify various options. These are referred to as the (general) `config` file and the `bands` file containing meta-information about the bands used in the original data.
If these files are not placed in the working directory, the path to them needs to be specified using the `-c` and `-b` command line options.

## Available classes

### Band

Data class used to store information about a passband.

The recommended way to construct instances is via a YAML config file.
Use the `Band.from_yaml_file(filename)` constructor to do so.

#### Parameters

name (str)
: Used for internal reference.

printname (str, optional)
: Used for output on figures.

wavelength : float, optional
: Used for checking order in RGB mode. Must be the same unit for all instances used simultanously.

unit : str, optional
: Unit of the wavelength, currently only used for display purposes, defaults to 'Âµm' if omitted.

instrument : str, optional
: Currently unused, defaults to 'unknown' if omitted.

telescope : str, optional
: Currently unused, defaults to 'unknown' if omitted.


#### Notes

Within the YAML file, the parameter names are abbreviated to the first four
characters each. The key for each sub-dictionary in the YAML file is used
as `printname` in the constructor, allowing for a more readable file.
When the `use_bands` argument is used, the names given there are expected
to match the `name` parameter, as is the case anywhere else in this module.
